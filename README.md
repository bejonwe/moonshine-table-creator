# Moonshine Table Creator
Generates a table for [PedroPegueroJr/moonshine-iconpack](https://github.com/PedroPegueroJr/moonshine-iconpack) with a preview of each icon and its name.
## How to use
Just copy the compiled binary to the cloned main folder of the [PedroPegueroJr/moonshine-iconpack](https://github.com/PedroPegueroJr/moonshine-iconpack) repository and run it. It will create a list.txt in the same directory, which contains a table in the "GitHub Flavored Markdown" format. This table contains all icons in the .PNG folder and links them to blob/master/.PNG/[ICONNAME].png .
